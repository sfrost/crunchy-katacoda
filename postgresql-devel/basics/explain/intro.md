# Getting Started With Explain

This class helps you understand how to interpret and use EXPLAIN with your PostgreSQL queries. EXPLAIN (and EXPLAIN ANALYZE) show you the query plan (and timing, by running the query) the PostgreSQL query planner uses to satisfy your query. 

This tool is one of the first things people will ask you to use when you say "My query is slow". While this tool will not fix your query, it will give you insight into how PostgreSQL planned the query and insight into where the time is being spent while your query is running.

## Query Planner
One of the most important part of any RDBMS is the query planner - the piece of the stack that takes your SQL and determines the most efficient method to find and process the data to get the result for you. Quoting the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/planner-optimizer.html)

> The task of the planner/optimizer is to create an optimal execution plan. A given SQL query (and hence, a query tree) can be actually executed in a wide variety of different ways, each of which will produce the same set of results. If it is computationally feasible, the query optimizer will examine each of these possible execution plans, ultimately selecting the execution plan that is expected to run the fastest.

## What is EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN ANALYZE

When you put EXPLAIN in front of your SQL query, instead of getting the results of the query, you get the plan the Query Planner would have used to execute your query. The format of the results is plain text but you can also ask for other formats (we will do this in the exercises). The results will include estimates of how many rows will be returned and the estimated average size of each row, and what indices, if any, will be used. To actually run the query and see the timing for each part of the plan, you would put EXPLAIN ANALYZE in front of the query.

> WARNING: EXPLAIN ANALYZE actually executes the SQL - so if your SQL is an update or delete it will actually change your underlying data! If you want to see actual timings for update, create, or delete queries but not change your data, wrap the statement in a transaction block that you rollback. 

### One of your primary diagnostic tools for query performance will be using EXPLAIN.

So let's dig in and see how to use EXPLAIN.

We have loaded up a PostgreSQL database with Storm Event data from 2018 in the US. Here are the details on the database we are connecting to:
1. Username: groot
1. Password: password (same password for the postgres user as well)
1. A database named: workshop
